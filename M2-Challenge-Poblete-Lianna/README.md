# Chatter Book API
Chatter Book API is an API for a new social media app called Chatter Book. This API fulfills the following user stories:
* As a user, I would like to get a list of all users so I know which users are on Chatter Book.
* As a user, I would like to get information about a specific user to learn more about that user.
* As a user, I would like to get all chatterPosts for a user so I know what they post about.

# Skills

### Spring Boot Skills
This project required an understanding of the Spring Boot framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
I utilized my skills to create a new project using Spring Initializr and integrate Spring Web dependencies.

### Java Programming Skills
I used Java to develop the backend for the Chatter Book API.
This included defining models for the User and ChatterPost entities and implementing logic within the controller.

### API Design and Implementation
I designed and implemented a RESTful API with GET routes.
I used my understanding of RESTful principles and HTTP methods to create routes for retrieving lists of all users, information about a specific user, and a list of a user's posts.

### Maven Skills
I used Maven as my project management and comprehension tool, defining project structure and managing dependencies.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture Knowledge
The task required the design of a system with distinct models (User and ChatterPost), controllers (ChatterbookController), and views (the JSON responses).

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
I used OOP principles in Java to create classes and objects for ChatterPost and User entities.
This included defining constructors, instance variables, and methods.

### JSON Understanding
I used my knowledge of JSON to create responses that are sent from the API.
This was used when creating lists of users and their posts.

### Spring Annotations
I made use of Spring Boot's annotations like @Controller, @GetMapping, etc., to define my controller and routing paths.

### Dependency Management
I added the Spring Web and Springdoc OpenAPI UI dependencies to my Maven project.

### OpenAPI Documentation
I used OpenAPI to document my API, making it easier for other developers or systems to understand and use the API's endpoints.

### Data Structures
I used my understanding of data structures, particularly lists, to store and manage collections of users and posts.

### IDE Usage
The project involved using IntelliJ IDEA as my integrated development environment, which included creating and managing a project, editing the source code, and running my application.

### Error Handling and Debugging
To ensure the API worked as expected, I needed to handle errors and debug issues that arose during development.
